In this project we aim to build a device based on the Kypruino UNO+ (same as Robo UNO+) that will be able to help visually impaired people navigate around obstacles and serve as a motion alarm to alert them to the presence of other people nearby.

To achieve this, we will need a microcontroller, sensors, wires and an enclosure to contain everything.


Parts List:

1x Kypruino UNO+
1x IR Obstacle Avoidance sensor
1x Motion sensor (PIR)
6x Female to Male Dupont wires
1x 3D Printed case
7x M3 X 6mm bolts
2x M2 X 6mm bolts

Parts Description:

Kypruino:
Kypruino is an open-hardware development board inspired by the good-old Arduino UNO R3. It was designed to be 100% compatible with the classic UNO R3, to use and expand the huge ecosystem around it, but redesigned from scratch with additional hardware features that make it a more comprehensive and versatile platform for enthusiasts and educators.


IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor:
An IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor utilizes an infrared transmitter and receiver, that forms the sensor pair. The transmitter LED emits a certain frequency of infrared, which the receiver photodiode will detect when reflected from an object placed in front of the sensor. When an object is detected, it will trigger the digital on/off “signal” pin when a specific threshold “distance” has been reached. This IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor returns a signal when it detects an object in range. The range of the sensor is around 2-30 cm with a detection angle of 35 degrees. The sensor has a potentiometer for range adjustment control. It operates at 3.5 to 5 volts at around 20 mA.


PIR Motion Sensor:
This Passive Infrared Motion Detector or PIR senses the infrared radiation emitted by all objects above absolute zero. When something passes in front of a PIR sensor it detects the change in background temperature and then triggers an output voltage. It has a sensing angle of ~100o and a range of up to 7m. The sensor features 2 potentiometers to adjust the sensitivity (and range) and the time delay before the sensor resets after detecting motion. It has an operating voltage of 4.5-12V.


3D Printed Case:
To keep everything organized and functional we will use a custom 3D printed case. The case has a place for everything to be mounted securely and a handle on the bottom for holding while using the obstacle avoidance mode. The handle doubles as a stand, to keep the case at the optimal angle while in motion detection mode.
